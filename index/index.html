        <p>My name is Eric Marsh and I am a programmer and web developer living in Boise, Idaho.  
          I started my freshman year of college and I have been obsessed with it ever since.
          My education emphasized the software engineering part of computer science, but I have since
          then been focusing
          on website and web applications. I am currently employed at Yardi Systems inc, and doing
          contract work on the side.</p>
        <p class="proxima-nova-bold">WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?</p>
        <p> I can help your ideas come to life! I love to make beautiful websites that are responsive, easy
          to use and work on any device.
          Whatever project you have in mind, send me a <a style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:#fda085" onclick="scrollToElement('.section-contact')">message</a> and we can talk about it! </p>

        <p>AreoLEDs is a aeronautics company based in Boise, Idaho that manufactures LED bulbs for aircrafts. 
           They provide warranties for their products, however their website was missing the functionality to 
           send and store warranties. In the Fall of 2019, I developed a warranty submission page complete with
           a backend to store all the warranty forms. It is now easier than ever for their customers to send their warranties,
           as well as for the employees to organize the warranty data.

          I help on all levels of this software, testing for and debugging bugs, providing fixes for clients, adding new features, and setting up and 
          modifying servers. It is nice to know that my work helps nurses perform their job easier.

        <p>In 2016, I was an intern at Digilent Inc in Pullman, Washington. Digilent provides technology-based educational tools 
          to teach electrical engineering concepts to students and hobbyists. Among their products are microprocessor and microprocessor modules.
          These mini computers can do many functions, from measuring pressure and temperature, to connecting to bluetooth, to hosting videogames. 
          I helped code libraries for their line of microprocessor modules, making it easier for users to get started with their projects. I also coded many exampled
          demos for these products. My favorite demo was a high five machine, which would use a motor to spin a robot arm, and a light sensor to detect
          when someone was high fiving it. I also wrote documentation and blog posts to help educate and sell their products. It was a rewarding experience
          to provide people the tools to educate themselves on engineering topics.</p>

        <p>Twist Bioscience is a San Francisco based company that manufactures synthetic DNA for the biotechnology industry.
          Their synthetic DNA has many applications, from detecting early cancer tumors, to storing OK GO music videos in DNA memory. 
          In 2015, I got an offer to help Twist Bioscience visualize some of their lab data. Previously, their vapor disposition lab data was 
          stuck in a LabVIEW program which didn't provide a lot of functionality for visualizing data. I helped by writing a Python script that grabbed this 
          labVIEW data and stored the raw data into an Excel document. It would also analyze the data using a Python data analysis library called Panda,
          and look for several things such as sudden changes in pressure or temperature, or the mean difference between lab tests. It was really exciting 
          to work with Biotech scientists and help analyze their data.

        <p>I attended the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho. Here I graduated in 2017 with a major in Computer Science and a
          minor in Mathematics.
          My studies gave me a strong understanding of the software engineering side of computer science.
          I learned how to program data structures in multiple languages, design and create compilers, and how
          to work with a team in building software.
          When I wasn’t studying, I had a part time job as a Music Director at the college radio station.
          At this job, I used my programming experience to create scripts to chart weekly music plays to online college-radio
          charting websites.  I benefited greatly from attending the University of Idaho, making a lot of life long 
          connections as well as learning how to get into the computer science industry.

        <p>One of my proudest achievements at the University of Idaho was working with Polymorphic Games.
          Polymorphic Games is a programming studio populated with undergraduate students, who were tasked with
          creating educational videogames that teach the foundations of evolutionary biology.
          Using genetic algorithms to program enemy AI, we were able to create a game that evolves based on the
          players actions.
          For example, if the player failed to kill enemies that were fast and had fire attacks, these traits would
          spread to the next wave of enemies, effectively making the game harder.
          This project helped me learn how to program AI, to develop software with other engineers, and to work with
          biologists and artists to create something great.

        <p>After college, I realized that I wanted to design and program websites and web applications.
          Although I was taught the fundamentals of programming websites in college, I still had a lot to learn.
          I decided to jump into the deep end of web development by challenging myself to program 30
          websites in 30 days.
          It started off really challenging and I sometimes struggled to make a website every day.
          But I eventually started to make some great websites.
          I learned to design beautiful pages using design frameworks such as bootstrap, to create fun and
          interactive front ends with jQuery and node.js,
          and to go the next level by integrating a backend through using PHP and SQL.
          Besides that, I discovered that the best way to learn new technology is to dive in and create something with
          it.
          I really enjoy revisiting these websites and trying all the silly and fun things I made. Feel free to
          revisit my journey through learning web development <a style="cursor:pointer;font-weight:bold;color:#6e81da" href="http://ericmarshblog.com/legacy/newIndex/" target="_blank" >here</a>.
